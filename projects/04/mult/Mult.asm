// Multiplies R0 and R1 and stores the result in R2.
//
// Assumptions:
// - R0, R1, R2 refer to RAM[0], RAM[1], and RAM[2], respectively.
// - You can assume that you will only receive arguments that satisfy:
//   R0 >= 0, R1 >= 0, and R0*R1 < 32768.
// - Your program does not need to test these conditions.
//
// Requirements:
// - Your program should not change the values stored in R0 and R1.
// - You can implement any multiplication algorithm you want.
